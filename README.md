# TAU Exercise 1 HTML and CSS

This repository contains the code and assets for my personal website, where I showcase information about myself, my hobbies, and how to get in touch with me. The website is built using HTML and styled with CSS.

## Menu
My website is designed to provide visitors with an insight into who I am, my hobbies, and a way to contact me. The site consists of the following pages:

- **About Me:** This page offers an introduction to who I am, including a brief personal description and an image of myself.
- **Hobbies:** Here, I share some of my favorite hobbies, including images and descriptions of each one.
- **Contact:** If you'd like to get in touch with me, this page provides a link to send me an email, along with an image related to contacting.
